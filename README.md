Autocomplete
============

Implement a program that provides an autocomplete interface via stdin and stdout. Upon start you'll need to read in the import/wordlist.txt, build whatever data structures make sense, and then wait for input on stdin. The user will enter in a series of characters and upon hitting enter should be presented with a lexicographically sorted list of strings that begin with their input string. After presenting the user with their results the program should once again wait for input on stdin.

To submit the solution please follow these steps.

1. Fork this repository and clone your copy locally.
2. Fill in setup.py (Use any dependencies you'd like).
3. Implement your solution in main.py. Think about the environments in which your solution will work best, and in which ones it may not perform well. Consider the time and space efficiencies of your solution as well, you'll be asked to defend your implemenation later. Additionally, given the structure of the input text are there any heuristics that can be applied to optimize your solution?
4. Submit a pull request against the master branch on the Azuqua fork.
